## ⚙️ Development

### Key Concepts:

- **Tool Selection**: Activating a tool allows players to interact with the world.
- **World Tiles**: A set of predefined tiles that players can modify (trees, rocks, dirt).
- **Inventory System**: Tiles are collected when interacted with and can be placed back into the world. Only the last collected tile can be placed back.

## 📝 Known Issues

- **Tile Placement Logic**: Ensuring tiles are placed correctly in the world has been challenging at times.
- **World Randomization**: Randomizing world generation while ensuring a realistic setup (trees on grass, rocks on the ground) requires careful management.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapting the world and inventory layout across different screen sizes has been challenging.
