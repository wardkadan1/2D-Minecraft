    - "World Tiles: Predefined world tiles that can be modified (trees, rocks, dirt, etc.)."
    - "Inventory: Tiles are collected when interacted with and can be placed back into the world. Only the most recently clicked tile can be placed back."

features_in_progress:
  - "Inventory system for storing tiles."
  - "Tool interaction logic (axe, pickaxe, shovel)."
  - "Ability to set world size (width and height)."
  - "Additional themes for world textures."

  - "Additional sound and visual effects for better gameplay experience."

known_issues:
  - "Tile placement logic: Making sure that tiles are placed back correctly in the world has been challenging at times."
  - "World randomization: Randomizing world generation while ensuring a realistic setup (trees on grass, rocks on the ground, etc.) requires careful management of tile positions."
  - "Responsive design: Ensuring that the world and inventory layout adapts well across screen sizes."
